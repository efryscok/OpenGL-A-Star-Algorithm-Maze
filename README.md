Instructions:

You are in a maze and must make your way from the green start position to the red finish position.
There are two AI opponents that are trying to chase you.
Red Opponent - quick but unless it has a direct line of sight to the player it will slowly wander.
Green Opponent - slower but will always be heading toward the player.
Also try not to use the Zooming while playing, I have only put that in so that you can better see the pathfinding

NOTE: Can only be ran in x86/Win32 configuration
